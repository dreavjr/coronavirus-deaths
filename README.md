# The Impact of COVID-19 on the Mortality Rate of Affected Countries

This was a small data science project I conducted for my own enlightenment. It is difficult to interpret quantitatively the impact of the pandemic, one way to make that easier is to contrast the deaths with the usual mortality rate on the affected countries. It is clear from the data that in some countries the pandemic is having a large impact on that number.

When we consider that the disease impact is not uniform in a country, and may concentrate on a few cities/regions, it is easy to see how existing health infrastructure may become overwhelmed.
